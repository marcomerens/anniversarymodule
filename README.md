# Module: MMM-Birthdays, a module to display upcoming birthdays

The MMM-Birthdays modules is derived from the inital development BIRTHDAYS created by Marco Merens.

Essentially it is a workout of the reporting in the display screen.

You can now see, what will be the age on the anniversary of someone and his/her year of borning.

The 'BIRTHDAYS' module is a costum module for [MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror). 
It displays the name, birthday and remaining days of a list of people sorted by whoever is next.

The module is simple and can be used to learn about how modules for MagicMirror are done.

The names and birthdays are provided on configuration. The module then calculates which one is next and the remaining days.
The dates are recalculated every hour.
